# Symmetric vs Asymmetric LPs

On THORChain, you are allowed to add liquidity in 1 of 3 ways: Rune-only, asset-only, or symmetric (both Rune + asset). What is the breakdown of liquidity being added, according to those categories? Are there any trends over time or by pool?
### What is Thorchain? 

Thorchain, which is built on the Cosmos blockchain, is a decentralized liquidity protocol that specializes in cross-chain connectivity, allowing traders to swap tokens between different networks. The native token of the Thorchain blockchian is RUNE.

### Methodology

- We are going to look at the total add liquidity events on Thorchain broken down by event type and liquidity pool.

- We are looking to see how Thorchain users have been providing liquidity in 2022. 

## Thorchain LP Metrics 

The graphs below show the weekly and total number of liquidity actions on Thorchain broken up by action type. In 2022 providing Rune-only to pools was the most popular way to provide liquidity. At the end of March there was a spike in asset-only LP actions and symmetric LP actions.

"""
The figure below shows the LP volume breakdown by pool of the diffrent Thorchain liquidity actions. Nearly half of all Rune-only LP action volume have gone into the BTC.BTC and ETH.ETH pool, while nealy half of all asset-only deposits have gone into the TERRA.UST and the BNB.BUSD pool.

## Conclusion
- Out of the 50 - 100 million YLDLY tokens swapped daily only between 1 and 3 million of them are swapped on DEXs other than Tinyman.

- There were 2 days in the past month where the YLDLY token swap Volume was over 120 Million tokens.
